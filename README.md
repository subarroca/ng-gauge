Flexible gauge graph made with SVG ang Angular2 that can be used as pie chart too.

## Installing
ng-gauge is available via npm
```bash
npm install ng-gauge -S
```

Import GaugeModule in your module
```typescript
import { GaugeModule } from 'ng-gauge';
```
And the models where you need them
```typescript
import { GaugeSegment, GaugeLabel } from 'ng-gauge';



## Usage:
```html
<ng-gauge></ng-gauge>
```
Set a width and height for the gauge and it will scale accordingly.

Example code can be checked in `src/app/app.html`
